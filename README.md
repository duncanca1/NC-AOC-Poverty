# NC-AOC-Poverty

This map displays all active animal operations that are required to be permitted by the state of North Carolina using point symbolization. County poverty rates are also shown using choropleth symbolization. The Animal Operation Permit data was sourced from the NC Department of Environmental Quality Online GIS. County poverty rates were sourced from the United States Census Bureau. The point cow symbol representing animal operations was sourced from FontAwesome. This map highlights the concentration of Animal Feeding Operations in low-income communities in Eastern North Carolina. The concentration of animal facilities in this region of the state is an issue of environmental justice, as the concentration of animals results in the concentration of their waste. As a result, waste is often stored in large lagoons. The odor and subsequent airborne contamination produced by these lagoons cause serious issues for neighbors of these operations, including air quality and water quality concerns.
